This repository contains a demo Streamlit application, serving as an illustrative example for the accompanying blog post.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
/my_streamlit_app/
|-- data/
|   |-- large_dataset.csv
|-- models/
|   |-- heavy_model.pkl
|-- src/
|   |-- data_loader.py
|   |-- model_loader.py
|   |-- predictor.py
|   |-- transformer.py
|   |-- analyser.py

```

## Overview

- `data/`: Contains a dummy dataset used for demonstration purposes.
- `models/`: Houses a placeholder model file.
- `src/`: Contains the source code files for various functionalities:
  - `data_loader.py`: Function to load the dataset.
  - `model_loader.py`: Function to load the model.
  - `predictor.py`: Function to make predictions using the loaded model.
  - `transformer.py`: A dummy transformer function.
  - `analyser.py`: A dummy analysis function.
  - `forecast.py`: A dummy forecasting function.
- `streamlit_app.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for the application.

## Usage

To run the Streamlit app locally, ensure you have the required packages installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, launch the app with:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Note

This repository is for demonstration purposes as part of a blog post. The functionalities are illustrative and may not represent a fully functional application.
